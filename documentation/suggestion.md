# The Suggestion box

When a client has a maintenance budget, here you can add code improvements. Here's a list for you to use. Some examples could be:

"Card 44 is not being used" ❌
"Card 44 does not have variations -- this could affect performance" ❌
"Refactored the login module to improve security" ✅
Adding notes like "this could affect performance" or "this could unify 3 components" will provide better context for Maria and me.

Finally, do not remove items once they've been added to the list. Instead, mark them as done so we can track progress and show the client the improvements we've made over time.

|  Item  | Status |
| ------ | ------ |
| Example |  ❌  |
